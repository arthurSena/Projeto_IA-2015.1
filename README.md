# Projeto_IA-2015.1
We are computer science students from the Federal University of Campina Grande and this project is a part of the Intelligence Artificial course. The project's goal is to compare some machine learning techniques about the classification of emails. These emails can be classified either as spam or not. At the end of this project, we want to find the best technique that classifies emails correctly.
